   About our ducks!
</h2>
<p>
    Since 2011 we here at Duck's have been serving our community by working on cars. When the owner <br>
    graduated high school he was lost and didnt know what to do. So he started fixing old cars as a way to pay rent.
    Like most fairytales this is where he found his love for helping people. That is what Duck's is all about.
    <br>Our mission statement is simple, help people get Ducked up before they go on a trip. So next time you are in
    need of your car getting brakes or an inspection, come on down to Duck's Garage!
